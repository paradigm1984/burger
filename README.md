# Eat-da-burger

### Overview:

A Node, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL burger app that lets users input the names of burgers and then eat them!

### Functionality:

Using aa custom ORM, the app has 3 basic CRUD functions:
  1. READ all entries from the MySQL database and display them to the DOM using Handlebars.
  2. UPDATE a selected burger by clicking "Eat It".
  3. CREATE a new burger using the "Place Order" form.

### Misc comments:

the application is incomplete. Still need to complete the eat function. Will also soon deploy to heroku.
